# 709. To Lower Case

Time: 0 ms, Memory: 16.54 MB

Given a string s, return the string after replacing every uppercase letter with the same lowercase letter.

 
Example 1:

Input: s = "Hello"
Output: "hello"

Example 2:

Input: s = "here"
Output: "here"

Example 3:

Input: s = "LOVELY"
Output: "lovely"

 
Constraints:

	1 <= s.length <= 100
	s consists of printable ASCII characters.

 # Thoughts:
 Honestly I did this just to boost the amount of overall problems I've done. I used the built in .lower() function. There's probably some mathematical way to do it with ASCII numbers but I don't know enough about ASCII to try. I will watch 
 a video about it now though in order to gain some knowledge in case I need to work with ASCII numbers in the future.
