# 389. Find the Difference

Time: 0 ms, Memory: 16.78 MB

You are given two strings s and t.

String t is generated by random shuffling string s and then add one more letter at a random position.

Return the letter that was added to t.

 
Example 1:

Input: s = "abcd", t = "abcde"
Output: "e"
Explanation: 'e' is the letter that was added.

Example 2:

Input: s = "", t = "y"
Output: "y"

 
Constraints:

	0 <= s.length <= 1000
	t.length == s.length + 1
	s and t consist of lowercase English letters.

# Thoughts:
Super easy problem. Make a dictionary of s that stores the counts of the letters. Then iterate through t and see if there's a letter that isn't in the dictionary. Also check to see if there is a letter but the count of the letter is 0. If 
either of those is true, return that letter. Otherwise, subtract 1 from the value in the dictionary and repeat until either of those values are true.
